Since we are both big soccer fans, we want to build an app that is centered around this summer’s World Cup in Russia. In the home dashboard of the app for guest users, there will be information about matchups and fixture lists, as well as live and upcoming games. We then further want logged-in, registered users to be able to pick a favorite team (or teams), track their success, see their fixture list, and maybe link to some match highlights if they are available. We also want users to be able to follow their favorite individual players and to track their success and statistics. Additional functionality could include keeping track of player stats as well as team statistics including total goals scored, goals against, record, etc.

There are a few things which will make this app interesting. The main one is the way in which the data objects interact with each other. Since the teams are playing games against each other, when one team’s data changes, the other teams changes accordingly, so we will have to code that relationship to be built in as well. Additionally, the data will also have sub-data involving players, stats, and other things of the like.

We have looked for some data libraries, and have found some interesting ones. The most promising is a World Cup API that we found; it returns JSON data of teams, matches, and rounds. This will be hugely beneficial to have in our app, and it will make coding it much easier. This code would be the most time-consuming and laborious to do ourselves, and so the fact that there’s an API where it exists already makes this project appropriately sized for our purposes. World Cup API: <a href="https://market.mashape.com/montanaflynn/fifa-world-cup">marketplace FIFA World Cup</a>.There are several other soccer APIs that could be helpful to us, including <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/goalapicom">GoalAPI.com</a> and <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/football-soccer-livescore">Football / Soccer Livescore</a>. The football-soccer-livescore API could be useful for us because we will want to display live scores and games if there are any currently in progress.
